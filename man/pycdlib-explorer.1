.TH PYCDLIB-EXPLORER 1 "Jan 2017" "pycdlib-explorer"

.SH NAME
pycdlib-explorer - tool to examine and modify ISOs using pycdlib

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pycdlib-explorer <iso-file>

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a tool to examine and modify existing ISO files on disk.
Using this tool, the files, directories, and metadata on an ISO
can be examined, new files can be added, and old files can be
deleted.  Note that due to the nature of the ISO standard,
files cannot be modified in place in a general way.  To accomplish
this, remove the file and then re-add it with new contents.

Note that due to the nature of the ISO standard, the commands that modify
the ISO only modify the in-memory copy.  No changes are made to the
original file until the \fBwrite\fR command is issued.

Also note that pycdlib-explorer has no command-line options; instead,
its behavior is controlled entirely at runtime through commands.
The following section describes the available commands in pycdlib-explorer.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B "add_file <iso_path> <src_filename>"
Add a new file to the ISO at relative path \fBiso_path\fR, using the
contents of the local file \fBsrc_filename\fR.
.TP
.B "cd <iso_dir>"
Change relative directories to \fBiso_dir\fR for exploration.
.TP
.B "cwd"
Show the current working directory.
.TP
.B "exit"
Exit out of pycdlib-explorer.
.TP
.B "get <iso_file> <out_file>"
Copy the contents of ISO relative path \fBiso_file\fR into \fBout_file\fR.
.TP
.B "graph"
Generate a plot representing the layout of the ISO.  WARNING: on large ISOs
with many files an directories, this can take a while!
.TP
.B "help"
Print the available commands.  Use "help <cmd>" for a more detailed
description of the commands, including the command-line arguments they
require.
.TP
.B "joliet_names"
Toggle whether Joliet names are printed or not.  By default, original
ISO9660-style names are printed, which are limited to 8 characters for
the name plus 3 characters for the extension.  Both the Joliet and
the Rock Ridge extensions increase this limit, but both cannot be
reasonably shown at the same time.  This command is a toggle, so
the first time it is run, it turns on showing of Joliet names, and
the next time it is run, it turns off showing of Joliet names.
Note that turning on Joliet names automatically disables showing
of Rock Ridge names, and vice-versa.
.TP
.B "ls"
List the contents of the current ISO directory.
.TP
.B "mkdir <iso_path>"
Make a new directory on the ISO named \fBiso_path\fR.
.TP
.B "quit"
Exit out of pycdlib-explorer.
.TP
.B "rm_file <iso_path>"
Remove the file named \fBiso_path\fR from the ISO.  Note that this
must be a file; to remove a directory, use \fBrmdir\fR.
.TP
.B "rmdir <iso_path>"
Remove the directory named \fBiso_path\fR from the ISO.  Note that
this must be a directory; to remove a file, use \fBrm_file\fR.
.TP
.B "rock_ridge_names"
Toggle whether Rock Ridge names are printed or not.  See the
discussion under \fBjoliet_names\fR for more details.  Like
joliet_names, this command is a toggle, so the first time it is
run, it turns on showing of Rock Ridge names, and the next time
it is run, it turns off showing of Rock Ridge names.
Note that turning on Rock Ridge names automatically disables showing
of Joliet names, and vice-versa.
.TP
.B "tree"
List the contents of the ISO in a tree-like format, similar to the
bash \fBtree\fR command.
.TP
.B "write <out_file>"
Write a valid ISO9660 file out to \fBout_file\fR, taking into
account any changes made while running the program.  This is
also sometimes referred to as "mastering" the ISO.  Note that
the \fBout_file\fR must NOT be the same file as the input
file, or the resulting ISO will not work properly.
